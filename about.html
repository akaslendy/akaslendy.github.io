My parents instilled in me an appreciation for the arts but I grew to really love them on my own. I now collect art and truly love listening to all kinds of music, it brings me joy to discover a new artist. Going to the movies is one of my favorite passtimes and I've collected quite a few tickets from going.</h3>
